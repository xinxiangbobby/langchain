    "\n",
    ">[PremAI](https://app.premai.io) is an unified platform that let's you build powerful production-ready GenAI powered applications with least effort, so that you can focus more on user experience and overall growth. In this section we are going to dicuss how we can get access to different embedding model using `PremAIEmbeddings`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by installing langchain and premai-sdk. You can type the following command to install:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install premai langchain\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding further, please make sure that you have made an account on Prem and already started a project. If not, then here's how you can start for free:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign in to [PremAI](https://app.premai.io/accounts/login/), if you are coming for the first time and create your API key [here](https://app.premai.io/api_keys/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Go to [app.premai.io](https://app.premai.io) and this will take you to the project's dashboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a project and this will generate a project-id (written as ID). This ID will help you to interact with your deployed application. \n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on creating your first deployed application on Prem ðŸŽ‰ Now we can use langchain to interact with our application. "
