# Groq

Welcome to Groq! ðŸš€ At Groq, we've developed the world's first Language Processing Unitâ„¢, or LPU. The Groq LPU has a deterministic, single core streaming architecture that sets the standard for GenAI inference speed with predictable and repeatable performance for any given workload.

Beyond the architecture, our software is designed to empower developers like you with the tools you need to create innovative, powerful AI applications. With Groq as your engine, you can:

* Achieve uncompromised low latency and performance for real-time AI and HPC inferences ðŸ”¥
* Know the exact performance and compute time for any given workload ðŸ”®
* Take advantage of our cutting-edge technology to stay ahead of the competition ðŸ’ª
