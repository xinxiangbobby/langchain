## ChatPremAI

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with different chat models with `ChatPremAI`

### Installation and setup

We start by installing langchain and premai-sdk. You can type the following command to install:

```bash
pip install premai langchain
```

Before proceeding further, please make sure that you have made an account on PremAI and already started a project. If not, then here's how you can start for free:

1. Sign in to [PremAI](https://app.premai.io/accounts/login/), if you are coming for the first time and create your API key [here](https://app.premai.io/api_keys/).

2. Go to [app.premai.io](https://app.premai.io) and this will take you to the project's dashboard. 

3. Create a project and this will generate a project-id (written as ID). This ID will help you to interact with your deployed application. 

4. Head over to LaunchPad (the one with ðŸš€ icon). And there deploy your model of choice. Your default model will be `gpt-4`. You can also set and fix different generation parameters (like max-tokens, temperature, etc) and also pre-set your system prompt. 

Congratulations on creating your first deployed application on PremAI ðŸŽ‰ Now we can use langchain to interact with our application. 

```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatPremAI
```

### Setup ChatPrem instance in LangChain 

Once we import our required modules, let's set up our client. For now, let's assume that our `project_id` is 8. But make sure you use your project-id, otherwise, it will throw an error.

To use langchain with prem, you do not need to pass any model name or set any parameters with our chat client. All of those will use the default model name and parameters of the LaunchPad model. 

`NOTE:` If you change the `model_name` or any other parameter like `temperature` while setting the client, it will override existing default configurations. 

```python
import os
import getpass

if "PREMAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["PREMAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("PremAI API Key:")

chat = ChatPremAI(project_id=8)
```

### Calling the Model

Now you are all set. We can now start by interacting with our application. `ChatPremAI` supports two methods `invoke` (which is the same as `generate`) and `stream`. 

The first one will give us a static result. Whereas the second one will stream tokens one by one. Here's how you can generate chat-like completions. 

### Generation

```python
human_message = HumanMessage(content="Who are you?")

chat.invoke([human_message])
```

The above looks interesting, right? I set my default launchpad system-prompt as: `Always sound like a pirate` You can also, override the default system prompt if you need to. Here's how you can do it. 

```python
system_message = SystemMessage(content="You are a friendly assistant.")
human_message = HumanMessage(content="Who are you?")

chat.invoke([system_message, human_message])
```

You can also change generation parameters while calling the model. Here's how you can do that:

```python
chat.invoke(
    [system_message, human_message],
    temperature = 0.7, max_tokens = 20, top_p = 0.95
)
```


### Important notes:

Before proceeding further, please note that the current version of ChatPrem does not support parameters: [n](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-n) and [stop](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-stop) are not supported. 

We will provide support for those two above parameters in later versions. 

### Streaming

And finally, here's how you do token streaming for dynamic chat-like applications. 

```python
import sys

for chunk in chat.stream("hello how are you"):
    sys.stdout.write(chunk.content)
    sys.stdout.flush()
```

Similar to above, if you want to override the system-prompt and the generation parameters, here's how you can do it. 

```python
import sys

for chunk in chat.stream(
    "hello how are you",
    system_prompt = "You are an helpful assistant", temperature = 0.7, max_tokens = 20
):
    sys.stdout.write(chunk.content)
    sys.stdout.flush()
```

## Embedding

In this section, we are going to discuss how we can get access to different embedding models using `PremEmbeddings`. Let's start by doing some imports and defining our embedding object

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import PremEmbeddings
```

Once we import our required modules, let's set up our client. For now, let's assume that our `project_id` is 8. But make sure you use your project-id, otherwise, it will throw an error.


```python

import os
import getpass

if os.environ.get("PREMAI_API_KEY") is None:
    os.environ["PREMAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("PremAI API Key:")

# Define a model as a required parameter here since there is no default embedding model

model = "text-embedding-3-large"
embedder = PremEmbeddings(project_id=8, model=model)
```

We have defined our embedding model. We support a lot of embedding models. Here is a table that shows the number of embedding models we support. 


| Provider    | Slug                                     | Context Tokens |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| cohere      | embed-english-v3.0                       | N/A            |
| openai      | text-embedding-3-small                   | 8191           |
| openai      | text-embedding-3-large                   | 8191           |
| openai      | text-embedding-ada-002                   | 8191           |
| replicate   | replicate/all-mpnet-base-v2              | N/A            |
| together    | togethercomputer/Llama-2-7B-32K-Instruct | N/A            |
| mistralai   | mistral-embed                            | 4096           |

To change the model, you simply need to copy the `slug` and access your embedding model. Now let's start using our embedding model with a single query followed by multiple queries (which is also called as a document)

```python
query = "Hello, this is a test query"
query_result = embedder.embed_query(query)

# Let's print the first five elements of the query embedding vector

print(query_result[:5])
```

Finally, let's embed a document

```python
documents = [
    "This is document1",
    "This is document2",
    "This is document3"
]

doc_result = embedder.embed_documents(documents)

# Similar to the previous result, let's print the first five element
# of the first document vector

print(doc_result[0][:5])
```
