    "pip install premai langchain\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Sign in to [PremAI](https://app.premai.io/accounts/login/), if you are coming for the first time and create your API key [here](https://app.premai.io/api_keys/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Go to [app.premai.io](https://app.premai.io) and this will take you to the project's dashboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a project and this will generate a project-id (written as ID). This ID will help you to interact with your deployed application. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Head over to LaunchPad (the one with ðŸš€ icon). And there deploy your model of choice. Your default model will be `gpt-4`. You can also set and fix different generation parameters (like max-tokens, temperature, etc) and also pre-set your system prompt. \n",
    "\n",
